Simple Calculator with Tkinter

In this project, you will create a simple calculator GUI using Python's `tkinter` module.
The calculator will have buttons for digits (0-9), basic operations (+, -, *, /), and special functions
like "Clear" and "=".

Step 1: Create the User Interface
---------------------------------
- Start by setting up a tkinter window.
- Add a label widget for displaying the current calculation or result.
- Add buttons for:
    - Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
    - Operations: +, -, *, /.
    - Special functions: "Clear" (to reset) and "=" (to evaluate).

Step 2: Core Logic
------------------
- When a button is pressed, append its value to the current expression in the display.
- When "=" is pressed, evaluate the expression and update the display with the result.
- When "Clear" is pressed, reset the display.
