Pokémon Simplified Battle Simulation

In this project, you will create a Pokémon battle simulation by utilizing the `pokedex.json` and `moves.json` files.

Step 1: Pokémon Creation
-------------------------
- First, create a `Pokémon` class with the following attributes:
    - name (str): The Pokémon's name (in English).
    - types (list[str]): A list of types (e.g., Water, Fire, Grass).
    - hp (int): The Pokémon's health points.
    - attack (int): The Pokémon's attack stat.
    - defense (int): The Pokémon's defense stat.
    - sp_attack (int): The Pokémon's special attack stat.
    - sp_defense (int): The Pokémon's special defense stat.
    - speed (int): The Pokémon's speed stat.

- The `Pokémon` class should also have a collection of moves based on the `moves.json`:
    - moves (list[Move]): A list of `Move` objects that the Pokémon can use.

- Create the following method for the Pokémon class:
    - use(skill, other): This method allows the Pokémon to use a move against another Pokémon.
    The damage calculation depends on the type of the move:
        - If the move is one of the following types:
            Normal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug, Steel, Ice, Dragon, or Dark, use the formula:
            - damage = ((skill.power * self.attack) / other.defense)
        - Otherwise, use the formula:
            - damage = ((skill.power * self.sp_attack) / other.sp_defense)

- After using a move, decrease its PP by 1. A move cannot be used if its PP is 0.
- Also, create a property for the Pokémon class:
    - knocked_out: This property returns `True` if the Pokémon's HP is 0 or lower

Step 2: Pokémon Moves
----------------------
- Create a `Move` class with the following attributes:
    - name (str): The name of the move.
    - type (str): The type of the move (e.g., Fire, Electric).
    - power (int): The move's power.
    - pp (int): The number of uses remaining for the move.

- Create the following property for the `Move` class:
    - usable: This property returns `True` if the move's PP is greater than 0.

Step 3: Pokémon Battle
-----------------------
- At the beginning of the program, prompt the player to select a Pokémon to use in battle and choose six possible moves for their Pokémon (based on type).
- Implement an infinite loop with the following steps:
    1. Create a new enemy Pokémon for the player to battle, and randomly assign its moves.
    2. Allow the player to select a move. If the PP for all moves is exhausted, immediately end their turn.
    3. The enemy Pokémon randomly selects a move to use against the player's Pokémon.
    4. End the game when either the player wins or loses.

Challenge:
----------
- Multiple Rounds: Can you implement a battle system with multiple rounds, where each round continues until one Pokémon is knocked out?
- Randomization: Can you make the Pokémon and their moves randomized for each battle?
- Damage Randomization: Can you add some randomness in the damage calculation to make the battle outcomes less predictable?
